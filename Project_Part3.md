The title "LET GO, and LET'S GO" implies to let go of poor mental health conditions such as depression by going on a vacation. I wanted to have a title that sounded intresting, and would make my viewers inquisitive. 

## Reflections from Part I and II
 
In Part I of the project, I decided I wanted to tell a story that focussed on two areas - mental health during the pandemic, and taking a vacation. Based on my personal experience, I created a timeline to show how my mental health deteriorated since the pandemic was declared and related restrictions such as lockdowns, work-from-home measures, and other new norms were enforced. My mental health dipped until I was vaccinated in early 2021. The shift in mental health trend highlighted that the vaccination drive across the globe was an indication of an opportunity for improved mental well-being, especially because the lockdowns were gradually being lifted and borders were open to tourism and social gatherings. My call to action was to travel and explore places and people to come out of the negativity, loneliness and depression knots in the brain as a result of being locked within the four walls of a house. As part of this deliverable I also highlighted how to choose a destination to visit, and guideline on how to plan a vacation. 

Though I introduced the two key areas in part I, in Part II I wanted to link the two to a single cause-action narrative. To do this, I created a data visualization indicating the prevalence of depression since the pandemic outbreak. The visualization was to highlight the impact of covid-19 on mental health across nations (and not just specific to me). I trust the visualization was a way to have my viewers learn there is an issue that needs attention. This visualization was followed by a storyboard about how taking a vacation/travel reprograms the brain in a way to increase productivity, creativity, and boost mental well-being. I spoke about the effect of travel on neuroplasticity, cognitive thinking, and the positive impact on openness to experience. Finally, I guided my viewers on how to go a step forward and plan a vacation. Though I had many countries to talk about, I chouse my home country - Qatar. I created visualizations to show the currency exchange rate in USA and Qatar, the population density, and finally created a video to show the blend of tourist attractions in Qatar. I also highlighted that Qatar would be hosting the FIFA World Cup 2022, and created a countdown so those who might not be able to plan a trip this Christmas still has about 365 days to plan for the coming year. 

**Based of feedback from users and audiences of my Part II, I am going to work on Part III of the project. The Part III deliverable will focus on the following:**

a. Digital visualizations of wireframes a storyboards from Part II 

b. Adapt the user research/review results and create additional visualization based on the feedback for my final narrative

c. Develop my final story

## Part III Summary

Based on feedback from the target audience that I identified and included as part of my user research sample set in Part II, I created the following additional visualizations:

a. Data visualization of travel trends in 2019 versus 2020 and 2021

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-slope" data-src="visualisation/7941541"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

As much as I knew about the drop in travel trends from 2019 to 2020 and a rising trend again since 2021, from TSA website I was able to find data to support the statement. I created a slope chart as I wanted to show the dip and rise in trend across the years. I segregated the data to averages across four quarters and used the colours of the season to distinguish the trend lines. For Q1(Jan-Feb-Mar), I used a blue shade(#0077b6) denoting winter season, Q2(Apr-May-Jun) in green (#2b9348I) denoting spring season, Q3(Jul-Aug-Sept) in yellow (#ffb700) denoting summer season and Q4 (Oct-Nov) in orange (#bb3e03) denoting Fall season. I would like to make note that 2021 Q1 trends did not increase significantly as the vaccinations were made available only by Q2. Though Q3 trends surpassed Q2, Q4 is still ongoing and we will not be able to confirm the true rise in trend for Q4 until the end of december 2021. The title of the chart "THE US TRAVEL TREND RISES AGAIN IN 2021" highlights the rise in trend for the year 2021 (as compared to the significant dip from 2019 to 2020) across USA. I also created a legend for the four shades used and placed them on the right hand side of the chart for early understanding. The x-axis (slope periods) indicate the years 2019,2020 and 2021, and y axis indicates the average number of travellers for each quarted in 2019 and 2021.


b. Safety in Qatar

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7948942"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I found data in the website for Numbeo that Qatar ranks the highest for satety index 2021 and the lowest for crime index 2021. Though I wanted to created a visualization with the names of all countries (perhaps by a world map), the visual looked really cramped in. I learned that this was because the index values are very close to each other and the visual did not highlight any evident distinction. Thus, I chose to use a column chart. Moreover, the column chart was a better way to show the comparison in terms of safety between the countries. I also modified the data set with just the top 20 countries. From the visual it is clear that Qatar tops the ranking, and Denmark ranks 20. I used a maroon shade (#8a1538) for Qatar as it resembles the flag of the country, and left the others in grey. My chart is titled "QATAR RANKS HIGHEST IN SAFETY INDEX 2021" followed by a subtitle "Top 20 countries by safety index". I first used the top of each bar to represent the safety index of the country, but there was no single color that was visible on the grey bars as well as the marroon bar for Qatar. So I removed the label from each bar and included the values along the Y-axis. To reduce eye travel, I further indicated the values as pop ups for each bar. 

c. Weather

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-slope" data-src="visualisation/7990031"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I first created a line chart to visualize the range of temperature, but later I realized that a scatter dot plot would convey my message more clearly. The visualization includes the range of temperatures through the year by months. I used a blue shade (#0077b6) for the low temperature average as it denotes cold, and yellow for the high temperature average (#ffb700) across the months. I titled the chart "BEST MONTHS TO VISIT QATAR - NOVEMBER TO APRIL" to reinforce the best climate months in the region. 

d. I used Flourish to build my graph based data visualizations and the safety index chart. 

Additionally, I incorporated changes suggested by my peers, the TA and professor in my visualizations of Part I and II that I included in my final version. These changes include:

a. Changed the title for the visualization that denotes how depression levels have increased since the lockdown. The title seemed confusing to my viewers as it read "THE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2020". I modified this to simpler words "DEPRESSION INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2020".

b. I also received feedback to include link to how they could plan a trip to Qatar. I used a click button in my story that redirect to a webpage to book flights to Qatar and another button for my viewers to plan their stay and activities when in Qatar.

**Additional Comments:**

Even though I created a visualization for the decrease in travel trend, I did not use it in my story. As I was working on my story, I realized it was too much information to cover in 60 seconds. Hence, I decided to focus on the rise in mental health conditions since the lockdown, followed by a call to action that highlights the benefit of travel. To conclude my story, I suggested my viewers to visit Doha. With a countdown, I wanted to let them know that even if they cannot visit the country immediately, they still have about a year to plan their visit during the FIFA World cUP 2022.

I wanted to find data that would support my call to action which highlights the benefits of travel on poor mental health. Unfortunately, I did not find data from a viable source regarding this. However, I read a multitude of research articles which confirm the call to action is indeed beneficial to those suffering from poor mental health.

## Audience:
Noting that my audience for the presentation would be my classmates, I highlighted the opportunity they have this break (after semester end exams) to fly again. I felt like the students would be excited about the FIFA world cup, so I chose not to eliminate that from my presentation.

Based on the review feedback/critique that I received in part II, I also included elements that my audience were interested to know about Qatar such as the weather and safety index.

**Lesson Learned from the presentation:**

Even though I practiced my presentation to limit it to 60 seconds, the feel in front of a crowd was different than in my room. The additional pauses during the presentation added to my time. I will remember to practice differently next time. Perhaps, pick one or two visualizations rather than all to convey my message.

From all the presentations I saw in class, the ones that stay in my mind are those that had a visual way to represent data unlike the usual bar, chart and column charts. Though these charts are useful to convey a message, it does not stay in the mind as much as visual representation by objects, especially when telling a story. I would like to keep this in mind as I continue to work on data that has potential to make an impact.
