The General government debt-to-GDP ratio is the gross debt of the government as a measure of GDP percentage. This ratio is an indication of the government finances. The range of values over the years is a telling tale about past govermental drawbacks in the country.

We will visualize this data for different countries.

__Government debt bar chart (Year: 2018)__

__Grid of line charts__


This chart represents each country individually, reflecting the ratio for the years from 1995 to 2020, distinctly indicating the value for year 2020 with a bigger dot.

**What do I like about this chart:**

a. The chart has a title indicating the result of study for the year 2020: Japan has the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio in 2020

b. Eye travel is minimal to find the value of data across the years: Value is marked on the line curve

c. The axes are labelled to indicate the data type

d. Usage of grey colour for axes (gridlines) to mute the overall noise from the chart bars/backgroud

**What would I like to change on this chart:**

a. The chart does not compare all countries simulatenously. The viewer has to make a study for each country individually, and then manually identify the most debted or least debt countries. I would like to make a chart that makes it easy for viewers to derive information/results about the data from the visuals.

b. There is a lot of information on this chart which could be reduced for clarity (depepnding on the audience). For instance, I might not need to show the data for all countries if my viewers are only interested to know about Asia. In addition, the time ranges from 1995 to 2020 which might not be necessary. I could also limit this depending on my audience/scope of presentation.

c. The chart looks too comprehensive with a lot of data that does not indicate any key result.

Overall, on a scale of -10 to 10, I would rate this dataviz a score of 5 for both, design execution and contextual awareness. 

__Third Data Visualization__


Incorporating points from "What I would like to change" about the previous visualization, I created 2 bubble charts to visualize the data more clearly. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/7691484"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

First, I grouped the dataset by categorizing the different countries and grouping them into regions. I made a bubble chart using complementary colours to represent the different regions (Oceania: #FFE203, Europe: #781EA8, Asia: #FC6500, Americas: #2889C6, Africa: #008A2E). I included a title on what the data is about, and highlighted the 1 region I wanted to focus the study on (This was based on the assumption that my viewers were interested in Asia). The title reads, "GOVERNMENT DEBT-TO-GDP RATIO ACROSS REGIONS: Asia ranks No. 2 following The Americas in 2020". I also added a subtitle decribing how the ratio was calculated. 

This method allowed me to incorporate all the data and distinguish them using colours that did not have any relation indicating that they are categorical data. Moreover, including all the data in a single view of pane allowed my viewers to infer information and make meaningful comparisons across the regions.

Noting that my audience are interested in information about Asia, I created another visualization focusing on countries across Asia alone. I chose to highlight the data for Japan because it remained a constant leader in the debts over the last 25 years. I highlighted this in the chart title, "Japan remains the highest debt country in Asia over the last 25 years", and gave the colour pink (Japan: #E7086E) to Japan, leaving the other countries in grey (#A9ADB0) to focus my viewers attention to Japan. 

__Summary__


The reason I chose a bubble chart was because I wanted to include atleast 3 variables in a single view - the regions, values (ratio of debt to gdp) and the year. The first chart (bar chart) gave the best view for a single year. The second, grid of line charts could not include all data into a single chart without making it look noisy. In other words, even though I was able to read the information, I was unable to deduce anything valuable or make comparisons just by looking at the visualization.

I trust that the purpose of visualization is to tell a meaningful story using data and visuals, wihtout the use of too many words or a cramped visual. The bubble chart helped me achieve that. I did not include the ratio (values) in the initial view of visualization, but the values pop up for a viewer who might be interested in the numbers. In summary, it conveys a result and the numbers or other more intricate details can be found by hovering the cursor on the bubble. 
The colours used and minimal words in the visual, with a title that summarizes the data makes it more appealing and inviting to the audience.

Using the various colours to represent the regions allowed me to portray that the data is categorical and not relational to one another. Moreover, with the bubble size altering based on the value (ratio), the viewers are able to interpret/compare the data for better understanding. Personally, the third visualizing helped me understand that Japan has significantly and linearly remained higher than other countries in the government debt-to-gdp ratio. 

__Future work:__

a. I would like to find a way to control the opacity of the bubble colours depending on the value it denotes. 

b. I would order the regions/country in alphabetical order.
