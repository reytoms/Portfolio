The General government debt-to-GDP ratio is the gross debt of the government as a measure of GDP percentage. This ratio is an indication of the government finances. The range of values over the years is a telling tale about past govermental drawbacks in the country.

We will visualize this data for different countries.

1. ##__Government debt bar chart (Year: 2018)__

2. ##__Grid of line charts__
This chart represents each country individually, reflecting the ratio from years 1995 to 2020, distinctly highlighting the value for year 2020.

**What do I like about this chart:**

a. The chart has a title indicating the result of study for the year 2020: Japan has the highest government debt-to-GDP ratio

b. Eye travel is minimal to find the value of data across the years: Value is marked on the line curve

c. The axes are labelled to indicate the data type

d. Usage of grey colour to mute the overall noise from the chart bars/backgroud

**What would I like to change on this chart:**

a. The chart does not compare all countries simulatenously. The viewer has to make a study for each country individually and manually identify the most debted or least debt countries. I would like to make a chart representing data for all countries in a single visual from which an inference can be made, or data can be compared

b. The time ranges from 1995 to 2020 which I consider very long and probably unecessary. I would rather include data over the last 10 years (maximum)

c. The chart looks too comprehensive with a lot of data that does not communicate any key result
