## Outlining your Christmas Tale

The most exciting time of the year is here - The holiday season is upon us!

Since the onset of COVID-19, many of us have not taken a vacation! The decline in travel has devasted both the economy of the country and eliminated job opportunities. But on a more personal note, I feel burned-out.
As a reader, I want to convince people to take a vacation this Christmas, because I consider it the best way to boost happiness, increase productivity, and improve both mental and physical well-being.

I can do this by introducing them to exciting destinations and tempting them to take the much needed break they deserve.

### __The Story Arc__

#### Set up:
Here is the reality about the timeline of my mental health. It has definitely deteriorated since the onset of the pandemic from early 2020 until mid of 2021.

#### Conflict: 
Christmas 2020 was celebrated amongst less than 5 people within closed doors. With effective vaccination drives in 2021, the global borders have re-opened for us to visit our dear ones across the oceans. Let's plan better for Christmas 2021.
As exciting as it is to plan a vacation, it is also hectic and confusing to pick just one out of the 195 beautiful countries across the globe. Though it is a challenge we all face oftentimes, we continue to deal with it. But this time, I am going to turn my challenge into an opportunity.
From the lessons we've learned as part of 'Telling Stories with Data' course, I decided to make the only challenging part about vacations as interesting as I can. I would like to take you with me as I pick my country to visit this Christmas. Perhaps, if you align with me through this process, we could be taking a holiday together!

As I narrate the story, I would like to consider the following points to derive a conclusion:

a. A visual of all the possible countries across the globe. This is to give an idea about all the possible options that we have. But, not all countries are Christmas friendly. That takes me to my next step.

b. The [Top 10 most visited countries in the world](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/10-most-visited-countries-in-the-world.html) - Limiting choices, better decisions.

c. Ideally, I would pick 2 out of 10: From the top 10, I would like to pick any 2 countries and do a comparison study between them. I will chose my top 2 based on the method of elimination. That is, I will eliminate countries that I might have already visited in the past, or require me to apply for a visa that could take longer than 3 weeks for approval, and distance from USA. 

d. Comparison between my top 2 choices: As a student, I would look at data relating to expenses of travelling to/from and staying in the country, leisure activities that excite me, commute within the country (public transport facilities), and the respective top tourist attractions.

e. I will try to quantify the benefits and drawbacks to come to a conclusion

#### Resolution: 
Though Covid-19 came with its inconveniences, I bet we were all able to save more money than before. 
With international borders reopened, let's splurge it on ourselves with a vacation to boost our mental well-being this Christmas!
