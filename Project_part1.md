## Outlining a Christmas Tale

The most exciting time of the year is here - The holiday season is upon us!

Since the onset of COVID-19, many of us have not taken a vacation! The decline in travel has devasted both the economy of the country and eliminated job opportunities. But on a more personal note, I feel burned-out. I am sure you would agree with me on that.

[Data indicating decline in 2020 US Travel](https://www.ustravel.org/system/files/media_root/document/Research_Fact-Sheet_Industry-Table.pdf)
 
The data realeased by Centers for diseases and control prevention highlights that 40% of US adults suffered from elevated adversarial mental health conditions during early pandemic. Younger adults, racial/ethnic minorities, and essential workers, reported having experienced disproportionately worse mental health outcomes, increased substance use, and elevated suicidal ideation.

As a narrator, I want to convince people to take a vacation this Christmas, because I consider it the best way to boost happiness, increase productivity, and improve both mental and physical well-being. I can do this by introducing exciting destinations and tempting them to take the much needed break that they deserve.

I would like to use the below elements to narrate my story.

#### Set up:
Here is the reality about the timeline of my mental health that deteriorated since the onset of the pandemic from early 2020 until mid of 2021.

![MENTAL HEALTH CHECK: 2021 GIVES YOU THE POWER BACK](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92896969/141698969-a9c84af6-1c90-4365-b783-e48525d44dd3.jpg)


#### Conflict: 

With effective vaccination drives in 2021, international borders have re-opened for us to visit our dear ones across oceans. Though Christmas 2020 was celebrated within closed doors, let's plan better for Christmas 2021.

As exciting as it is to plan a vacation, it could also be hectic and confusing to pick just one out of the 195 beautiful countries across the globe. With the help of visualization, I am going to turn this challenge into an opportunity.

I would like to take you with me on this journey as I choose my destination for Christmas 2021. Perhaps, if you align with me through this process, we could be taking a holiday together!

I would like to consider the following points to derive a conclusion:

a. A visual of major tourist destinations across the globe. This is to give an idea about all the possible options that we have. But, not all countries are Christmas friendly. That takes me to my next step.

b. The [Top 10 most visited countries in the world](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/10-most-visited-countries-in-the-world.html) - Limiting choices, better decisions.

c. Ideally, I would pick 2 out of 10: From the top 10, I would like to pick any 2 countries and do a comparison study between them. I will chose my top 2 based on the method of elimination. That is, I will eliminate countries that I might have already visited in the past, or require me to apply for a visa that could take longer than 3 weeks for approval, economic viability and distance from the USA. 

d. Comparison between my top 2 choices: As a student, I would look at data relating to expenses of travelling to/from and staying in the country, leisure activities that excite me, commute within the country (public transport facilities), and the respective top tourist attractions.

e. I will try to quantify the benefits and drawbacks to come to a conclusion

#### Resolution: 
Though Covid-19 came with its inconveniences, I bet we were all able to save more money than before. 
With international borders reopened, let's spend it on ourselves with a vacation to boost our mental well-being this Christmas!


## Sketches to help visualize the data

Let's together plan a vacation.

1. Picking a destination from over 190 countries worldwide

2. Top 10 countries by number of visitors

From the sketches in 1 and 2, it looks like France is the most visited country by tourists. 

3. It could be challenging to choose a country from many options. Hence, it is important to reduce the options by the method of elimination. Below are some of the points to consider for elimination:

 a. Based on duration of travel

b. Economic feasibilty

I would like to add more elements to this section and create a single visualization with data for multiple countries. I would have a filter option to choose the category of comparison such as the feature element (currency, or travel duration), and the respective country name.

4. Finally, a highlight of the tourist attractions in the city of choice. In this sketching I have included a tour guide map for France only. But in my final project I would include more countries from the available options.

## Data

As of now, I have used 3 main datasets as part of this project:

a. [Mental Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm)

This data is extracted from the Centers of Diseases Control and prevention website. The data indicates the mental health conditions suffered by the US population during the pandemic. From this data  

b. [The statistics in decline of travel since COVID-19](https://www.ustravel.org/system/files/media_root/document/Research_Fact-Sheet_Industry-Table.pdf)

Using this data source, I would like to create a visualization of how travel and tourism economy have dropped since 2020. I would like to use a stick chart to show the decline from pre-covid to post.

c. [The data set of the top 10 countries for tourism](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/10-most-visited-countries-in-the-world.html)

This data set identifies the top countries to visit this Christmas. 

Note: The data being used is captured as links within the respective sections of the project.

I would like to use these data sets as my primary source for investigation purpose and to fetch statistical numbers of value regrading travel and tourism. Despite  these numbers being useful to my work, I expect to be identifying additional features by myself. To build on my project I will be using more arbitrary information such as the duration of travel to the different countries of choice, citizens of which all countries require visa to visit specific destinations, tourist attractions in the destination of choice, and commute expenses (bus rate versus train rate versus cab rate) amongst other things. As I continue to work on this project, I will be referencing the data where required.

As of now some of the effective data visualizations I would like to embed include:

Bar charts

Stick Chart

Bubble charts

Geographic Map

Simple tables of comparison

## Method and Medium

I would like to use Shorthand for the final compilation of my story. From a quick research of the tool, I believe that the single page view of it will keep my story rolling by a simple scroll. I hope to use interactive charts with appealing colors (especially to create a tour map of France), fonts, and an apt-title. I believe embedding images create personability with the viewers, so I might consider that as well.

Below is my planned methodology for the successful completion of the project:

1. Additional Data Collection
2. Sketching of visualization
3. Peer review to ensure my visuals are clear - user interviews
4. Shorthand page creation with the updated visuals
5. Refining the story using text, labelling, colors, story arc and references to enhance clarity and appeal
6. Gather additional feedback
7. Incorporate changes as required
8. Finals Thoughts

As I continue to work on my story, I would also like to include a section to document the challenges I face and how I overcome them. I consider that a good self-reminder and a way to connect with the viewers of my portfolio. 

Noting that this is my story, it could be biased to my likes and preferences. I will note that as a comment. However, the method of arriving at the conclusion is what I would like for my viewers to take away. That is, how to plan your vacations and what features should be considered.
