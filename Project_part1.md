# Outline to your Christmas Holiday

The most exciting time of the year is here - The holiday season is upon us!

As exciting as it is to plan a vacation, it is also hectic and confusing to pick just one out of the 195 beautiful countries across the globe. Though it is a challenge we all face every year, we continue to deal with it. But this time, I am going to turn my challenge into an opportunity.
From the lessons we've learned as part of 'Telling Stories with Data' course, I decided to make the only challenging part about vacations as interesting as I can. I would like to take you with me as I pick my country to visit this winter. Perhaps, if you align with me through this process, we could be taking a holiday together!

As I narrate the story, I would like to consider the following points to make a conclusion. 

a. A visual of all the possible countries across the globe. This is to give an idea about all the possible options that we have. But, not all countries are Christmas friendly. That takes me to my next step.

b. The [Top 10 most visited countries in the world](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/10-most-visited-countries-in-the-world.html) - Limiting choices, better decisions.

c. Chosing 2 out of 10: From the top 10, I would like to pick any 2 countries and do a comparison study between them. I will chose my top 2 based on the method of elimination. That is, I will eliminate countries that I might have already visited in the past, or require me to apply for a visa that could take longer than 3 weeks for approval, distance from USA. 

d. Comparison between my top 2 choices: As a student, I would look at data relating to expenses of travelling to/from and staying in the country, leisure activities that excite me, commute within the country (public transport facilities), and the respective top tourist attractions.

e. I will try to quantify the benefits and drawbacks to come to a conclusion

f. Conclusion: I have decided to visit _____________ this holiday season!
