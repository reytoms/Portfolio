## __Step one: Find a data visualization__

[2020 Tokyo Olympics medal count: USA tops China in gold, silver, bronze and overall medal totals] (https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/tokyo-olympics-final-medal-table-usa-leads-in-in-gold-silver-bronze-and-overall-with-more-than-100-medals/)


## __Step two: critique the data visualization__

Summary of the critique:

Noting that the intended audience are followers/fans of the Olympic Games, I would consider the visualization as useful, though not appealing. It does give the information without discrepancies or much confusion as it includes required information in terms of the medal counts for the different countries. I would also like to highlight that "no medal" is denoted by a “0” rather than a blank space. A blank space would open room for confusion. I did not notice any incorrect information or inaccurate comparisons made. However, I had to confirm this based on research across other websites. There were no references indicated in the chart. In terms of intuitiveness, though the data in the chart is not too hard to understand, the visualization is not inviting or visually intuitive. 
Perceptibility, Aesthetics and Engagement are the sections where I would give a comparitively lower rating. If the comparison was just between China and USA (as the title states), then I would give a higher perceptibility rating because the count of medals for both countries are topping the list. However, considering that the intended audience are fans of Olympic Games in general (not limited to USA and China), I would give a relatively lower score because the title is somewhat inaccurate/misleading. Viewers who are not interested in the comparison between China and USA, might not care about the visualization. Furthermore, if a viewer was interested only in the numbers of a particular country, they would have to scroll all the way up again because as the chart rolls lower, the colomn titles are hidden. This could leave the viewer confused about what the number in each column represents unless he scrolls back to the top and reads the title again. In terms of aesthetics and engagement, the visualization does not include preattentive visual features. I was distracted by flag icons rather than the medal tally. In addition, the data is not easily comparable from the chart (too many numbers). In case a viewer wants to know the order of countries by the number of gold medals alone, the visualization is not user-friendly (not interactive).
 

## __Step three: wireframe a solution__

 
Note: 

a.	The sketch is not drawn for all countries. The goal was just to show how the data would be visualized. 

b.	Content not written neatly. I will fix this in the final visualization by printing the title and other written data.

## __Step four: Test the solution

Below are response from different audiences:

**Question 1: Can you tell me what you think this is?**

 Friend 1: Is this a medal tally for some games? Until I saw the title, I was confused which games this was referring to.
 
 Friend 2: Medal tally for the Olympics Tokyo 2020 

**Question 2: Can you describe to me what this is telling you?**

 Friend 1: It tells me that USA, China, and ROC topped the Olympic games 2020.

 Friend 2: It tells me that the medal counts are arranged in descending order and tells me the count of each medal.

**Question 3: Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?**
 Friend 1: I was keen on knowing about a specific country (Australia) which was not immediately visible. I scrolled my eyes through the country list till I found Australia.
 
 Friend 2: The shades used for gold and bronze look similar

**Question 4: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?**
 
 Friend 1:  The people who follow The Olympics (fans)
 
 Friend 2: Olympic fans and Team officials from the participating countries.

**Question 5: Is there anything you would change or do differently?**

 Friend 1: I would include the sorting buttons for the country column as well

 Friend 2: I would increase the contrast between gold and bronze to make it more distinct.

# __Take away:__

The feedback was very valuable to me. Though I noticed that the reviewers were not confused by the visualization, there were some key points that highlighted ways by which I could better the visualization. 

Some key takeaways are:

I have decided to add a sorting button for the “Country” column as well. I will also try to use an appropriate palette to distinguish the gold and bronze better. Personally, I am not very content with my title. I feel like it is too wordy so I would like to change that as well.
