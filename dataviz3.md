Step one: Find a data visualization

[2020 Tokyo Olympics medal count: USA tops China in gold, silver, bronze and overall medal totals]

Usefulness. Is it useful for the intended audience? Does it communicate valuable information?
	Noting that the intended audience are followers of the Olympic Games, I would consider the visualization useful. It does give the information without discrepancies or much confusion.

Completeness. Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable?
	Yes, it has all required information in terms of the medal counts for the different countries. I would like to highlight how no medal is denoted by a “0” rather than a blank space. A blank space would open room for confusion. 

Perceptibility. Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? Is the visualization type appropriate? Does it use illogical comparisons?
	If the comparison is just between China and USA (as the title states), then I would give a higher perceptibility rating because the count of medals for both countries are topping the list. However, considering my intended audience as fans of Olympic Games in general (not limited to USA and China), I would give a relatively lower score. This is because the other counts are further down the chart, while the column titles remain stationary to a single pane of view. It requires effort and eye travel to match the numbers to the column headers.

Truthfulness. Is the visualization accurate, reliable and valid? Is it representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make comparisions that aren't correct?
	I did not notice any incorrect information or comparisons made. However, I had to confirm this based on research across other websites. There were no references indicated in the chart, hence not all viewers would blindly trust the data. 

Intuitiveness. Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information? If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instructions on how to interpret it?
	Though the data in the chart is not too hard to understand, the visualization is not inviting. 

Aesthetics. It is interesting / enjoyable to look at? Is it a good example of what a beautiful data visualization might look like? Is it somewhere in the middle - pleasing but otherwise not distracting to look at?
	I would give a comparatively lower rating to both aesthetics and engagement. The visualization is not very inviting. I was distracted by flag icons rather than the medal tally. In addition, the data is not comparable. In case a viewer wants to know the order of countries by the number of gold medals alone, the visualization is not friendly.
 
WHAT STOOD OUT:
	I like that the data visualization is not too noisy. I was able to immediately understand that the data was talking about comparison between countries before I read the title. 

WHAT DIDN’T WORK:
a.		I was distracted by the flags which appear louder than the other information. From reading the title, I understand looking at the numbers is key to understanding the context of the article, but the numbers are not visually appealing.
b.	Though the chart appears clean with limited information, the comparison between countries and their respective medal tally is not visually intuitive.
c.	As I scroll over towards the end of the page, I am not able to map the numbers to the context. In other words, the column headers are restricted to a single pane, and I had to keep scrolling back and forth to relate the numbers to the category.

WHAT WOULD I DO DIFFERENTLY:
	
a.	I would like to allow my viewers to be able to sort the information by the country name, and/or medal count (gold, silver, bronze, total)
b.	I would minimize the size of the flag and adjust all font sizes relatively and appropriately. 
c.	I would add colors to the visualization such as gold to denote the number of gold medals, perhaps grey for silver medals, and a shade like bronze to denote bronze medals. I would also include the count within the shade so the viewer can understand the data almost immediately.
d.	The current title highlights the comparison between USA and China only. I would use a more generalized title which does not limit my comparison between just 2 countries. 


Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not? *

I would assume the primary audience are the fans or followers of the Olympic Games. I consider the visualization is effective to reach the audience, but the visual encoding is poor which might not attract audience to view the article. In other words, unless someone is particularly looking for the medal tally of Tokyo 2020, it is possible to look past this visualization without realizing it.

Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.) *
 
The scale covered most aspects of the visualizations, but I would also include some points on more specific critique points such as:
a.	 The visual effects of the data visualization. Is the data interactive? Is it possible for viewers to interact with the data for detailed insights?
b.	The typography and color palettes. Are they attractive or noisy? Does it draw attention? Are the font sizes appropriate? Are there a lot of white spaces that may be eliminated for clarity?
c.	The title – is it in line with the content? Are the axes labeled and marked rightly? 
d.	Does the visualization provide additional information to validate the information such as reference of source, links to details, etc.
e.	What other methods can be used to visualize the data.


 
Step three: wireframe a solution

 

Note: 
a.	The sketch is not drawn for all countries. The goal was just to show how the data would be visualized. 
b.	Content not written in 

Step four: Test the solution

- Can you tell me what you think this is? 

Friend 1: Is this a medal tally for some games? Until I saw the title, I was confused which games this was referring to.
Friend 2: Medal tally for the Olympics Tokyo 2020 

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you? 
Friend 1: It tells me that USA, China, and ROC topped the Olympic games 2020.
Friend 2: It tells me that the medal counts are arranged in descending order and tells me the count of each medal.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Friend 1: I was keen on knowing about a specific country (Australia) which was not immediately visible. I scrolled my eyes through the country list till I found Australia.
Friend 2: The shades used for gold and bronze look similar

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Friend 1:  The people who follow The Olympics (fans)
Friend 2: Olympic fans and Team officials from the participating countries.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Friend 1: I would include the sorting buttons for the country column as well
Friend 2: I would increase the contrast between gold and bronze to make it more distinct.

Take away:

The feedback was very valuable to me. I have decided to add a sorting button for the “Country” column as well. I will also try to use an appropriate palette to distinguish the gold and bronze better.
Personally, I am not very content with my title. I feel like it is too wordy.
