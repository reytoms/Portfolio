##__Step one: Find a data visualization__##

[2020 Tokyo Olympics medal count: USA tops China in gold, silver, bronze and overall medal totals]
(https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/tokyo-olympics-final-medal-table-usa-leads-in-in-gold-silver-bronze-and-overall-with-more-than-100-medals/)


##__Step two: critique the data visualization__##

Noting that the intended audience are followers/fans of the Olympic Games, I would consider the visualization as useful, though not appealing. It does give the information without discrepancies or much confusion. It includes required information in terms of the medal counts for the different countries. I would also like to highlight that "no medal" is denoted by a “0” rather than a blank space. A blank space would open room for confusion. I did not notice any incorrect information or comparisons made. However, I had to confirm this based on research across other websites. There were no references indicated in the chart, hence not all viewers would blindly trust the data. In terms of intuitiveness, though the data in the chart is not too hard to understand, the visualization is not inviting or visually intuitive. 
Perceptive, Aesthetics and Engagement are the sections where I would give a comparitively lower rating. If the comparison was just between China and USA (as the title states), then I would give a higher perceptibility rating because the count of medals for both countries are topping the list. However, considering that the intended audience are fans of Olympic Games in general (not limited to USA and China), I would give a relatively lower score because the title is somewhat inaccurate/misleading. Viewers who are not interested in the comparison between China and USA, might not care about the visualization. in terms of aesthetics and engagement, the visualization is not very inviting. I was distracted by flag icons rather than the medal tally. In addition, the data is not comparable. In case a viewer wants to know the order of countries by the number of gold medals alone, the visualization is not user-friendly.
 

##__Step three: wireframe a solution__##

 
Note: 
a.	The sketch is not drawn for all countries. The goal was just to show how the data would be visualized. 
b.	Content not written in 

Step four: Test the solution

- Can you tell me what you think this is? 

Friend 1: Is this a medal tally for some games? Until I saw the title, I was confused which games this was referring to.
Friend 2: Medal tally for the Olympics Tokyo 2020 

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you? 
Friend 1: It tells me that USA, China, and ROC topped the Olympic games 2020.
Friend 2: It tells me that the medal counts are arranged in descending order and tells me the count of each medal.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Friend 1: I was keen on knowing about a specific country (Australia) which was not immediately visible. I scrolled my eyes through the country list till I found Australia.
Friend 2: The shades used for gold and bronze look similar

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Friend 1:  The people who follow The Olympics (fans)
Friend 2: Olympic fans and Team officials from the participating countries.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Friend 1: I would include the sorting buttons for the country column as well
Friend 2: I would increase the contrast between gold and bronze to make it more distinct.

Take away:

The feedback was very valuable to me. I have decided to add a sorting button for the “Country” column as well. I will also try to use an appropriate palette to distinguish the gold and bronze better.
Personally, I am not very content with my title. I feel like it is too wordy.
