# __Step one: Find a data visualization__

Being a huge fan of the Olympic Games, I was particularly interested in this visualization. I recall during the olympic season this year, I came across a similar visualization of the medal tally which was not visually appealing and easily interpretable. Before I could make sense of the numbers presented, the screen already transitioned to the next. I had to then find other sources for the same data, or wait until the channel displayed the visual again.
Another reason I chose this was because it is a fairly recent data set. I trust that the viewers to my recreated visualization of the same data would enjoy refreshing their minds about the success of the recent Summer Olympics.

# __Step two: critique the data visualization__

Summary of the critique:

Noting that the intended audience are followers/fans of the Olympic Games, I would consider the visualization as useful, though not appealing. It does give the information without discrepancies or much confusion as it includes required information in terms of the medal counts for the different countries. I would also like to highlight that "no medal" is denoted by a “0” rather than a blank space. A blank space would open room for confusion. I did not notice any incorrect information or inaccurate comparisons made. However, I had to confirm this based on research across other websites. There were no references indicated in the chart. In terms of intuitiveness, though the data in the chart is not too hard to understand, the visualization is not inviting or visually intuitive. 
Perceptibility, Aesthetics and Engagement are the sections where I would give a comparitively lower rating. If the comparison was just between China and USA (as the title states), then I would give a higher perceptibility rating because the count of medals for both countries are topping the list. However, considering that the intended audience are fans of Olympic Games in general (not limited to USA and China), I would give a relatively lower score because the title is somewhat inaccurate/misleading. Viewers who are not interested in the comparison between China and USA, might not care about the visualization. Furthermore, if a viewer was interested only in the numbers of a particular country, they would have to scroll all the way up again because as the chart rolls lower, the colomn titles are hidden. This could leave the viewer confused about what the number in each column represents unless he scrolls back to the top and reads the title again. In terms of aesthetics and engagement, the visualization does not include preattentive visual features. I was distracted by flag icons rather than the medal tally. In addition, the data is not easily comparable from the chart (too many numbers). In case a viewer wants to know the order of countries by the number of gold medals alone, the visualization is not user-friendly (not interactive).

Noting these critique points, I would like to wireframe a new visualization for the same data.
 

# __Step three: wireframe a solution__

Some key changes I would like to incorporate in my wireframed solution:

a. Visual representation of the medal counts denoting the medal type (Gold/Silver/Bronze) in a single view 

b. Sorting options for bith the medal types as well as the total count

c. Change of title highlights the key leader, rather than comparison between just 2 countries

Note: 

a.	The sketch is not drawn for all countries. The goal was just to show how the data would be visualized. 

b.	Content not written neatly and clearly. I will fix this in the final visualization by printing the title and other written data.

# __Step four: Test the solution__

Below are response from different audiences:

**Question 1: Can you tell me what you think this is?**

 Friend 1: Is this a medal tally for some games? Until I saw the title, I was confused which games this was referring to.
 
 Friend 2: Medal tally for the Olympics Tokyo 2020 

**Question 2: Can you describe to me what this is telling you?**

 Friend 1: It tells me that USA, China, and ROC topped the Olympic games 2020.

 Friend 2: It tells me that the medal counts are arranged in descending order and tells me the count of each medal.

**Question 3: Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?**
 Friend 1: I was keen on knowing about a specific country (Australia) which was not immediately visible. I scrolled my eyes through the country list till I found Australia.
 
 Friend 2: The shades used for gold and bronze look similar

**Question 4: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?**
 
 Friend 1:  The people who follow The Olympics (fans)
 
 Friend 2: Olympic fans and Team officials from the participating countries.

**Question 5: Is there anything you would change or do differently?**

 Friend 1: I would include the sorting buttons for the country column as well

 Friend 2: I would increase the contrast between gold and bronze to make it more distinct.

## __Take away:__

The feedback was very valuable to me. Though I noticed that the reviewers were not confused by the visualization, there were some key points that highlighted ways by which I could better the visualization. 

Key changes to be made:

I have decided to add a sorting button for the “Country” column as well. I will also try to use an appropriate palette to distinguish the gold and bronze better. Personally, I am not very content with my title. I feel like it is too wordy so I would like to change that as well.

# __Step five: Build your solution__










## __Summary:__

The final step is to incorporate the critique points and revisualize the data digitally.
At first it was a little challenging to find the right platform that could display the data, but eventually I learnt that it was possible from Tableau. 

a. I included the sum of gold, silver, bronze and total medals to the "Measure Values" category.

b. The country names were added as rows to the visualization.

c. As I am not very familiar with the software, I spent sometime trying to understand how I could demonstrate the medal icon and use different colours to denote the different medal types. I was able to achieve this by choosing the "Use Separate Legends" option available in the "Measure Values" drop down menu.

d. I used the following colour palette: Hex Color #D4AF37 (Gold), Hex Color #A8A9AD (Silver), Hex Color #A97142 (Bronze), Hex Color #FFFFFF (Total). I used a white shade for for sum of total as it does not signify any specific color.

e. Considering the review feedback, I included a sorting option for all columns.

f. I made sure all my fonts and font sizes are relative and uniform to make the visualization look clean.

e. I gave a title that clarifies the key result derived from visual that USA has a clear lead amongst all other participating countries.

## __Challenges faced__

a. I was unable to add the number value inside the circle mark for each column. I will continue my research and try to find a way to make that possible.

b. I could not add the flag icons to the country names. I trust it would be good to have that included, and would like to take that forward as part of my future work.
