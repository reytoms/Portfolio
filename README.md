# Reyma's Portfolio 
This is my public portfolio for 94870 - Telling Stories with Data @ Carnegie Mellon University!

#### __About Me__

Hi! My name is Reyma and I use the she/her pronoun. I am a graduate student in Information Security and Policy Management @ CMU. 

I am so glad you've visited my page!

Fun fact: I've represented my country at the Youth Olympics, and let the National Anthem play at various other international grounds. In case I am not reachable over the phone or a text message, you will find me at the gym. 
I believe in colours. I trust that they add life to pretty much everything. I embrace differences in race, color and ethnicity - everything unique to us makes us beautiful together!
I am a passionate Information Security Professional with about 5 years of work experience. In other words, I have a lot of data to conceal, yet stories to share ;)

#### __What I hope to learn__

My brain cells are clustered with data that needs some organizing to better match, map and make sense of it all! I am confident this course is going to help me do just that - use the plethora of information to narrate a meaningful and colourful story.
I aspire to build appealing visuals with impressive and communicative data.

#### __Lessons Learned and Take Aways from the course__

I learned about the little things that make a difference, and that can enhance the impact of a message being conveyed. Until I completed this course, I was not aware of the power of visual appeal, and interactive charts when giving a presentation. I also learned that data was meaningless if it could not be communicated appropriately and accurately. It has been my pleasure to learn how to communicate key points by the use of visuals, colors and contrast in about 60 seconds.

Critique activities were a beneficial method to look at visuals from different perspectives and incorporate the review remarks in our own work.

Lastly, an advice I hold close is to be excited about giving presentations rather than anxious. The best way to do that is by owning the story. 

A self note: Nobody knows your story better than you present it!
