# Reyma's Portfolio 
This is my public portfolio for 94870 - Telling Stories with Data @ Carnegie Mellon University!

#### __About Me__

Hi! My name is Reyma and I use the she/her pronoun. I am a graduate student in Information Security and Policy Management @ CMU. 

I am so glad you've visited my page!

Fun fact: I've represented my country at the Youth Olympics, and let the National Anthem play at various other international grounds. In case I am not reachable over the phone or a text message, you will find me at the gym. 
I believe in colours. I trust that they add life to pretty much everything. I embrace differences in race, color and ethnicity - everything unique to us makes us beautiful together!
I am a passionate Information Security Professional with about 5 years of work experience. In other words, I have a lot of data to conceal, yet stories to share ;)

#### __What I hope to learn__

My brain cells are clustered with data that needs some organizing to better match, map and make sense of it all! I am confident this course is going to help me do just that - use the plethora of information to narrate a meaningful and colourful story.
I aspire to build appealing visuals with impressive and communicative data.
