# Project-Telling-Stories-with-Data
This is my public portfolio for 94870 - Telling Stories with Data @ Carnegie Mellon University!

#About me

Hi! My name is Reyma and I use the she/her pronoun. I am a graduate student in Information Security and Policy Management @ CMU. 
I am so glad you've visited my page!

I believe in colours. I trust that they add life to pretty much everything.
A passionate Information Security Professional , with a lot of data to conceal yet stories to share ;)

#What I hope to learn 

My brain cells are clustered with data that needs some organizing to better match, map and make sense of it all! I am confident this course is going to help me do just that - use the plethora of information to narrate a meaningful and colourful story.
I aspire to build appealing visuals with impressive and communicative data!
