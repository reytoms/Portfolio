## Workflow

A review of my previous submission (Part 1) helped me understand that I need to build a connection between the two elements of my story: Mental Health and the positive impact of travel on it. 

To achieve this, I have collected more refined data on the impact of covid-19 on the mental health across nations. My data set includes the percentage in mental health trends pre-covid(until 2020) and post covid (from 2020). Though depression was prevalent over the years, there has been a significant rise in mental health concerns since the outbreak of the pandemic. 

The visualization below is insightful to see the increase in percentage of mental health concerns such as the rising case of anxiety and depression.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7871555"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

For this visualization I chose to make a grouped column chart because I wanted to show the comparison for each country side-by-side for pre covid and post 2020.I chose colors from the depression shades palette from coolers. I used a light shade for the pre-covid data (Pre-Covid color code: #cfd5f8) and a darker shade of the same hue for post 2020 (2020 color code: #514484). This is because I wanted to draw attention to the data for 2020, but I also wanted my viewers to consider the pre-numbers for comparison purposes, and to make note of the impact COVID-19 has had on the mental health especially towards depression.
Some other factors I considered for this visualization includes a title that reads "TTHE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2020". I trust this title reinforces the data displayed in the visual. The word "prevalent" is meant to signify that mental health has not occured simply because of covid, but related concerns have significantly increased by COVID-19. I also used a legend to indicate the different colored bars and an axis label to indicate what the values indicate. Finally, I referenced the source of my data as a footnote to the chart.

In my personal opinion, I am not surprised by the numbers neither am I impressed by it. However, I feel like these numbers need to be spoken about to let everyone know that we are all in this together!

Staying away from friends and family especially on the big days were difficult, but so was closing yourself within the four walls of your room whether for work or leisure. It is no longer impossible to imagine being locked down, but rather depressing and "SAY NO!".

As part of this submission I would like to work on the following:

a. Highlight the increase in mental health concerns due to covid-19 (wireframed in the chart above)

b. Create a visualization about the positive impact of travel on mental well-being

c. Take away the stress of vacation planning by providing guidelines on how to travel

d. Invite the viewers to my home country - Doha Qatar: Highlight the tourist experiences

e. Draw comparison of USA versus Qatar in terms of exchange rate of currency, population size, weather and and duration of travel.


## Storyboard

I want to create a storyboard particularly to draw the connection between travel and mental health. In other words, I would like to chart out how exactly travelling can boost the emotional morale and influence creativity and productivity of an individual. 




Wireframes and storyboards


User research and interviews

Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.
