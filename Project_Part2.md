I would like to make note that my story will follow the theme of two colours - the combination of Pink and Blue Shades.
From the cooler palette, I learnt that blue complements depression as well as travel. To highlight the benefits of travel I decided to chose the blend of both shades as they look bright and enriching!

The exact shades for the theme of the story are: 3a0ca3 (Blue) and b5179e (Pink)

## Workflow

A review of my previous submission (Part 1) helped me understand that I need to build a connection between the two elements of my story: Mental Health and the positive impact of travel on it. 

To achieve this, I have collected more refined data on the impact of covid-19 on the mental health across nations. My data set includes the percentage in mental health trends pre-covid(until 2020) and post covid (from 2020). Though depression was prevalent over the years, there has been a significant rise in mental health concerns since the outbreak of the pandemic. 

The visualization below is insightful to see the increase in percentage of mental health concerns such as the rising case of anxiety and depression.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7871555"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

For this visualization I chose to make a grouped column chart because I wanted to show the comparison for each country side-by-side for pre covid and post 2020.I chose colors from the depression shades palette from coolers. I used a light shade for the pre-covid data (Pre-Covid color code: #cfd5f8) and a darker shade of the same hue for post 2020 (2020 color code: #514484). This is because I wanted to draw attention to the data for 2020, but I also wanted my viewers to consider the pre-numbers for comparison purposes, and to make note of the impact COVID-19 has had on the mental health especially towards depression.
Some other factors I considered for this visualization includes a title that reads "TTHE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2020". I trust this title reinforces the data displayed in the visual. The word "prevalent" is meant to signify that mental health has not occured simply because of covid, but related concerns have significantly increased by COVID-19. I also used a legend to indicate the different colored bars and an axis label to indicate what the values indicate. Finally, I referenced the source of my data as a footnote to the chart.

In my personal opinion, I am not surprised by the numbers neither am I impressed by it. However, I feel like these numbers need to be spoken about to let everyone know that we are all in this together!

Staying away from friends and family especially on the big days were difficult, but so was closing yourself within the four walls of your room whether for work or leisure. It is no longer impossible to imagine being locked down, but rather depressing and "SAY NO!".

As part of this submission I would like to work on the following:

a. Highlight the increase in mental health concerns due to covid-19 (wireframed in the chart above)

b. Create a visualization about the positive impact of travel on mental well-being

c. Take away the stress of vacation planning by providing guidelines on how to travel

d. Invite the viewers to my home country - Doha Qatar: Highlight the tourist experiences

e. Draw comparison of USA versus Qatar in terms of exchange rate of currency, population size, weather and and duration of travel.


## Storyboard

I want to create a storyboard particularly to draw the connection between travel and mental health. In other words, I would like to chart out how travelling can boost the emotional morale and influence creativity and productivity of an individual. I will do this by making a series of visualization which together compile a story board.

**Visual 1:** Self-Care bingo highlights "Travel" amongst the other possible things one can do to get over the feeling of depression. I would like to then link the effect of travel on mental health in the following visual 2.

**Visual 2:** This visual can be considered a storyboard in itself. "MIND WHERE YOU GO" is a short journey of an equipped mind to a more relaxed, happy mind. From my personal experience, travelling has helped me explore, learn and grow. The exposure from meeting people of different cultures and lifestyle, looking at the world from their perspective and learning something new (perhaps a language), or trying a new cuisine, are all experiences that help us evolve in creativity, and mindset. Depression could arise from loneliness or the fear of being lonely. Travelling is a great opportunity to meet friends and family, and even make a new friend along the journey.

“Vacation travel as a means for getting away from the rigors of work and relaxing a few times a year is proven to be beneficial to overall mental health” -  U.S. Air Force Capt. Abigail Wolfe (86th Medical Group psychologist)

<img width="323" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-19 at 4 06 02 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92896969/142691643-69fc4b62-5895-4569-881a-b1c75a4fe48d.png">

From this story board, I would like to take my viewers along a journey from poor mental health to an elevated mood shift. 
Openness to experience is critical to one's personality because it makes the person less resistant to day-to-day challenges and subsequently positively impacts emotional stability and improves their interpersonal interacrions. 

Neuroplasticity is the ability of the neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. When an individual travels, they put themselves in challenging situations that might require them to either communicate a non-verbal language using creativity to convey a message, engage in encounters that they might not have been exposed to in the past and/or think through situations that are not common to the otherwise everyday lives. Travel thus, positively contributes to building new connections in our brain, making us more creative, and adaptable.

The third step to elevated mood that I have highlighted is the cognitive flexibility of the brain to shift from thinking about one concept to another.  The quicker you are able to switch your thinking from one dimension to another, the greater your level of cognitive flexibility. Rigid thinkers on the other hand are poor at adapting to new novel stimuli and shifting their thinking to accommodate various changes.

The ability to work on these 3 areas is key to a better mental health. From this storyboard I aspire to invoke the willingness in my viewers to incorporate these 3 key abilities with travel.

**Visual 3:** Travel Checklist

Now that my viewers are convinced about taking the journey towards a healthier mental well-being, here's a quick checklist for them to strike off as they make their way to a healther and happier self!

Finally, I would like to introduce them to a country that they could visit. I choose to present some facts about Qatar (my home country) that would be insightful to my viewers.

3. The USA is ruled by a democracy while Qatar is ruled by the heredity monarch family.
4. Finally, I would like to highlight some tourist attractions in Doha and make a countdown to the FIFA World Cup 2022 which is going to be hosted in Doha.

User research and interviews

Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.
